# Face Detection

Face detection has gained a lot of attention due to its real-time applications. A lot of research has been done and still going on for improved and fast implementation of the face detection algorithm. Why is face detection difficult for a machine? Face detection is not as easy as it seems due to lots of variations of image appearance, such as pose variation (front, non-front), occlusion, image orientation, illumination changes and facial expression.

# Haar Cascade Classifier

It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive (images with face) and negative images (images without face). The algorithm is proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.

# LBP Cascade Classifier 

LBP is a texture descriptor and face is composed of micro texture patterns. So LBP features are extracted to form a feature vector to classify a face from a non-face. 

# Steps :

       # 1.Loading HaarCascadeFace Algorithm
       
       # 2.Initializing Camera
       
       # 3.Reading Frame from Camera
       
       # 4.Converting Color image into Grayscale Image
       
       # 5.Obtaining Face coordinates by passing algorithm
       
       # 6.Drawing Rectangle on the Face Coordinates
       
       # 7.Display the output Frame
